## About me

My name's Brian. I'm a computer science student at the RWTH University in Aachen, Germany. I enjoy working on small projects, mostly written in Go, reading about math stuff, and other quirky engineering subjects, such as communcation protocols. Besides that, I enjoy making music and tinkering around with my guitars. To my background: I was born in Romania, moved to Germany with 14 years of age, gratued Highschool and started a computer science degree. I speak 4 languages: Romanian, German, English, and Spanish. If you wish to read more stuff written by me then you're in the right place. Also, occasionally I'll post summaries of my class materials on github.
